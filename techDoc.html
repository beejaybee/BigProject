                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented programming language. it is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programatic control over them. <br> 
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
                of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:   
            </p>

            <ul>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                        For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place element on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, user-input, and page-Navigation. 
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
                        For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one
                        invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulation on a server.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

                This guide assume that you have the following basic background:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A general understanding that of the internet and the World wide web (WWW).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Good working knowledge of Hypetext Markup Language(HTML).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in others. The JavaScript language resemble Java but
                does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expresion syntax, naming convetions and
                basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed LiveScript to JavaScript. 

            </p>

            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declaration, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                number of data types respecting numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of
                more common class-object based model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is,
                what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
                Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed method.   
            </p>
                
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes and methods. You do not
                have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
            </p>

            <h1 id="hello_world">Hello World</h1>

            <p>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratched and write your first "Hello World" JavaScript code.
            </p>

            <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) {alert("Hello " + yourName);}
            </code>
            <br> <br>
            <code>
                greetMe("World");
            </code>

            <p>
                Select the code in the pad and hit <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> to watch it unfold in your browser.

            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
                conform to certain rules.
            </p>

            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_) or dollar sign($);
                subsequent characters can also be digits(0-9). Because JavaScript is a case sensitive,
                letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

            <h1 id="declaring_variables">Declaring Variables</h1>

            
            <p>
                you can declare variables in three ways:  <br><br>

                with the key word var. for example,
                </p>
            

            <code>var x = 1;</code>

            <p>
                This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                By simply assigning it a value. for Eample,
            </p>

            <code>x = 42;</code>

            <p>
                This always declares a global variable. It generates a script JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the keyword let for example, 
            </p>

            <code>
                let x = 34;
            </code>
            <p>
                This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variables. See Variable Scope below.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code 
                in the current document. When you declare a variable withinn a function, it is called a local variable, because the scope of x
                is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>
            
            <code>
                if (true) {var x = 5;} console.log(5) // 5
            </code>
